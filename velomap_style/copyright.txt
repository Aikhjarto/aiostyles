General Notes:
The maps work best on your PC when using Mapsource 6.16 or Basecamp 3 - See here for Installation Guide:  www.velomap.org/tutorials/install-mapsource/
Please don't complain that something does not work until having read the tutorials. To achieve good maps, I have to do things a bit differently to what you are used to. So read the tutorials. Autorouting is for MTBiking and Hiking only. The autorouting does not respect local laws but instead aims to provide the best / most beautiful to reach the destination.

No VeloMap has yet caused any damage to a Garmin GPS. However I cannot guarantee for this. By installing/using these maps you accept that you may not sue www.velomap.org for anything.

-- Autorouting uses different Format than other maps, please read this - if you don't know this information autorouting will fail: www.velomap.org/about-2/autorouting/
