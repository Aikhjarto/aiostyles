About the www.velomap.org Maps - Please Read - Short Installation Help - See my Homepage for detailed instructions

Please don't askme questions on how to install the maps. Everything is well explained on www.velomap.org in the Tutorials Section. In principal you just need to run velomap*_setup.exe
There are many internet forums dedicated to Garmin maps, those are your best bet when having problems with the installation.

Also note that you can't simply click in mapsource to select maps if you have added contourlines, but you have to drag the map selection tool over the area you want to send to your GPS. If you can't see streets on your GPS but mainly background stuff, you have not followed this step.

You can install the maps to any folder you wan't, but never move the folder with the installed maps inside without first uinstalling.
I take no responsibility whatsoever if your Mapsource installation does not start anymore (though for around 99.9% of users everything runs o.k., and the rest should read the tutorials one more time...

There is currently only 1 TYP-File (velo*.typ). Openmtmap TYP-Files are incompatible.


You can also look at the maps with Qlandkarte GT from www.qlandkarte.org. Qlandkarte does not need to have maps installed, but can open them.
For PDAs/Smartphones you can use "Garmin Mobile XT" (which is not free).

You find the subscribe options in the left sidebar on the frontpage under "Subscripe and Receive an email on new Posts" - if you click on the letter you can subscribe by e-mail. the other two buttons are RSS feeds.

Autorouting options are explained here: www.velomap.org/about/autorouting/

Autorouting on GPS does not work over very long distances without setting via points (Dakota/Oregon/Colorado/Nuvi can calculate much longer routes than etrex/gpsmaps/edge series GPS). So in order to route over longer distances either use Mapsource, or work your way forward on the GPS. See the tutorial section on the website on how to send routes over longer distances from Mapsource to your GPS. In General car/motorcycle and faster time will give you best routes - but only over short distances. Bicycle and shorter distance might work over longer distances but the streets/ways takes might be not so nice to cycle.

Avoid unpaved roads avoids all roads not suitable for road bicycles. Never check "avoid U-turns nor check "avoid highways".

Autorouting is not meant to be used by motor driven vehicles. Please use another map to autoroute when driving a car.

Please Note: I take no responsibility for the maps working 100% nor the map data being correct (there will always be some inccorect map data in Openstreetmap). I have not heard of maps breaking your GPS but it could happen as I am always using newest version of mkgmap to create the maps. To be safe best transfer the maps to external memory cards and not on internal GPS memory.
