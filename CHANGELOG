tweak some access-restrictions for base- and bikemap -- work in progress

AIO-Bikemap
cycleroute highlighted
motorway and trunk nonroutable types

2013-02-09

AIO-basemap:
remove some overlays in 'lines'
use highway=path with bicycle=designated|yes as highway=cycleway
change road_speed for minor roads to adjust bicycle-routing (incomplete)
adjust some restrictions for barrier=bollard

AIO-bikemap:
add AIO-bikemap with changed routing-rules, work in progress,
it's difficult to adapt the way-types from motor-vehicles to bicycles
Any hints?
